  # Fix Applications Table RLS Policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Allow anonymous users to create applications (INSERT)
    - Allow anonymous users to view their own applications (SELECT)
    - Allow anonymous users to update their own applications (UPDATE)
    - Maintain existing authenticated user policies

  This enables the public application form to work while maintaining security.
