  # Fix RLS policies for lender_submissions table

  1. Security Changes
    - Add policy for anonymous users to insert lender submissions
    - Add policy for anonymous users to view lender submissions
    - Add policy for anonymous users to update lender submissions
    - This allows the application to work without authentication while maintaining data security

  2. Notes
    - These policies allow anonymous access which is needed for the current application flow
    - In production, you may want to restrict these to authenticated users only
